        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p> This is a classic cheesecake recipe with graham cracker crust.
                You will need cream cheese to make this cheesecake. Also you will 
                need a spring pan or a pan with a detachable base, so that you can easily 
                remove the cheesecake without breaking it.

        <h4>For the cheesecake filling:</h4>

            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Preparing biscuit crust for cheesecake</em></li>
            <p> Take 10-12 crackers, break them and add into a blender.
                Grind it into a fine powder and transfer it to a mixing
                bowl. Mix butter with this and press this biscuit + butter mixture
                to a small glass or bowl. Keep this in the fridge so that the 
                biscuit layer sets. </p>

            <li><em>Making the cheesecake filling</em></li>    
            <p> Take the cream cheese, sugar, and the vanilla extract and mix 
                them together. With an electric beater, beat this mixture.
                Whip till smooth. Now add 1/2 cup cream.
                Again beat the mixture till the cream is blended very 
                well and you see a homogenous, creamy, thick smooth 
                mixture.</p>  
                
            <li><em>Baking the cheesecake</em></li>
            <p> Now pour the whipped cream cheese layer in the pan.
                With a spatula, even the top.</p>
            <p> Preheat oven at 180Â° celsius for 15 minutes.
                Keep the pan in a preheated oven and bake for 30-40 minutes.</p>
            <p> To check doneness,  the sides will look firm, risen and the center of the cheesecake will be wobbly.</p>

            <li><em>Cooling the cheesecake</em></li>
            <p> Let the cheesecake cool at room temperature. 
                Then cover with a foil or an air tight lid and place the pans
                in the fridge for 4 hours or more. You can also keep it overnight.</p>
