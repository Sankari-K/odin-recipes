        <h1>Lasagna</h1>
        <img src="../img/lasagna.jpeg" alt="Lasagna">
        <h3>Description</h3> 
            <p> This classic lasagna is made with an easy tomato sauce as the base. 
                The cheese sauce is made with different types of cheese and italian seasoning. 
                Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! 
                This is great for potlucks and freezes well, too.</p>

            <p> Make sure the noodles aren't overcooked. This dish needs structure, since they
                have a lot of ingredients between them. </p>  
            <p> To prevent the noodles from sticking together after they are boiled,
                drain the noodles from the pasta pot and then  slick them with olive oil. </p>  
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>

            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 ounces tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>

            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Put pasta water on to boil</em></li>
            <p> Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts 
                of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for 
                a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta 
                water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water 
                is heating.</p>

            <li><em>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic</em></li>    
            <p> Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet.
                Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. 
                Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.</p>
            
            <li><em>Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce ingredients to build the sauce</em></li>
            <p> Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. 
                Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.
                Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, 
                tasting after each addition, to taste. 
                Add salt to taste. Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. 
                Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often.</p>

            <li><em>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</em></li>
            <p> Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions.
                When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating 
                any noodles that may be sticking together.</p>

            <li><em>Heat the oven to 375Â°F</em></li>

            <li><em>Assemble the lasagna</em></li>
            <p> In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish. 
                Arrange one layer of lasagna and add other ingredients. Repeat this until done</p>

            <li><em>Bake</em></li>
            <p> Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil and bake for around 45 minutes.</p>

            <li><em>Cool and serve</em></li>
            <p>Allow the lasagna to cool at least 15 minutes before serving.</p>
